# HomeFinder
HomeFinder is a home inventory app that helps you keep track of the locations of every important item in your house. Create a digital database of your items and never lose track of your valuables again!

## Features
- HomeFinder is user-specific, utilizing Firebase authentication. Unless shared, user-generated data is only viewable when signed in.
- A fully customizable “Rooms” page allows you to tailor the site to your individual type of home. You can create and edit as many individual rooms as you’d like. 
- Once you begin filling your rooms with items, you can also check all of the items located in that particular room by simply clicking on the Room’s card on the Rooms page.
- You can add, edit, and remove items in your database through the single click of 1-2 buttons.
- A built-in search bar allows you to search through all of the items in your home and easily locate a pesky hidden item.
